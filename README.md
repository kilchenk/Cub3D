Welcome to cub3D, your first RayCaster with miniLibX!

## Introduction
cub3D is a project inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game, designed to introduce you to the world of ray-casting. In this project, we are creating a dynamic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using the principles of ray-casting.

## WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT?

The goal of the project is to create your own game by using an MLX library
and implement a graphical design of the legendary video game Wolfenstein 3D
(hence the name of the project) by using raycasting!

## CUB3D MANDATORY PART

For the mandatory part the task was to implement raycasting with different walls
when facing a different cardinal direction. Ceiling and floor are being drawn just
by the color stated in the map file.

## CUB3D BONUS PART

In the bonus part I have implemented animated sprites, minimap, mouse, textured drawing of floor and ceiling
as well as the possibility to draw sky. Moreover, there is a possibility of adding
doors which can be opened and closed during the interaction with E and Q keys. Additionally, there is music when
the game is launched, though optimized for MacOS.

## Examples

Check out the examples provided in the project documentation for visual representations of the game environment and bonus features in the [subject](subject.pdf).

## COMPATIBILITY

Currently compatible with MacOS only.
